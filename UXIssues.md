# UX Issues

```Quoted Issues with respect to pages```

## Login page:

- Error Handling Mechanisms : No prompts are present while user tried to input an invalid credentials and tries to login.
- Forgot password link: This could be implemented over login page, as of now there isn't any password recovery method available
- Show password functionality to verify (which would unmask the password) after typing is missing.

## HomePage : 

- App could greet the end user after logging in, a welcome prompt would be great,
- PlaceHolder such as 'Search Here' / something alike which would improve usability and end user experienece. Also some utility to clear the search box would be useful.
- Navigation bar towards left (Drawer) is missing options for viewing user profile, account options, previous ride history etc. 

## DriverProfile Page:

- Would be validating all possible scenarios 1-8 mentioned in case of valid rider as quoted above.
- In addition to above scenarios benefits provided to the user could be validated such as reduced prices, faster booking etc.
